- Use a route file for each main view (e.g. Home, Formatter).
- Use React Router `<Routes>` and `<Route>` components to declare navigation structure.
- Use `<Link>` or `<NavLink>` (not plain `<a>`) for internal navigation.
- Each page/route should own its own main section of state, not global variables.
